- The system shall allow admins to view platform-wide analytics and take corrective actions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**1. Scalability**
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

**2. Security**
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

**3. Performance Optimization**
- Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

**4. Testing**
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.

## Technical Requirements

**1. Database Management**
- Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

**2. API Development**
- Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

**3. Authentication and Authorization**
- Use JWT for secure user sessions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between guests, hosts and admins.

**4. File Storage (Scenario based)**
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary.

**5. Third-Party Services**
- Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

**6. Error Handling and Logging**
